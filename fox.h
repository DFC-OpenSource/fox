/* A workload is a set of parameters that defines the experiment behavior.
 * Check 'struct fox_workload'
 *
 * A node is a thread that carries a distribution and performs iterations.
 *
 * A distribution is a set of blocks distributed among the units of parallelism
 * (channels and LUNs) assigned to a node.
 *
 * An iteration is a group of r/w operations in a given distribution.
 * The iteration is finished when all the pages in the distribution are
 * programmed. In a 100% read workload, the iteration finishes when all the
 * pages have been read.
 *
 * A row is a group of pages where each page is located in a different unit
 * of parallelism. Each row is composed by n pages, where n is the maximum
 * available units given to a specific node.
 *
 * A column is the page offset within a row. For instance:
 *
 * (CH=2,LUN=2,BLK=nb,PG=np)
 *
 *             col      col      col      col
 * row ->   (0,0,0,0)(0,1,0,0)(1,0,0,0)(1,1,0,0)
 * row ->   (0,0,0,1)(0,1,0,1)(1,0,0,1)(1,1,0,1)
 * row ->   (0,0,0,2)(0,1,0,2)(1,0,0,2)(1,1,0,2)
 *                          ...
 * row ->   (0,0,nb,np)(0,1,nb,np)(1,0,nb,np)(1,1,nb,np)
 *
 * This struct is used to keep the current read/write pointers in the iteration.
